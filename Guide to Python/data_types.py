# String, integer, float, boolean, list (container for data types),
# tuple (cannot be changed), set (every value must be unique and I can
# compare sets to filter data), dictionary (organized).

# There are also more, less common, datatypes.

# The type() function tells me the data type of the argument.

print(type(2))
print(type(int))
print(type(type))

# Functions to change data types: int(), float(), str(), bool(), list(), dict(),
# tuple(), set()...

# There are other data types I don't explicitly use:
#   - None (absence of value)
#   - sequence ( to get a range of numbers)
#   - Bytes, complex numbers, memoryview, frozensets (more specific types of
#     data I will see for highly specific pruposes).
